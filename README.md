# HEALTH-STATUS-PREDICTION-EX-AI_

Our project leverages AI/ML applications in healthcare, specifically focusing on building a binary classification model for predicting health status. The objective is to determine the health status of an individual to be either excellent or poor, based on the profile-centric attributes such as age, sex, BMI, previous ailments, dietary habits (e.g., fruit and vegetable consumption, fried potato intake), and lifestyle behaviours (e.g., alcohol consumption, smoking history). The project involves exploration of decision trees, random forests, multinomial logistic regression, XGBoost, LightBGM, and CatBoost models to enable precise health categorization, thus ensuring effective assessment based on diverse input features. Additionally, our project emphasizes the integration of explainable AI, enabling patients and medical professionals to comprehend the decision-making process and the impact of individual features on the overall healthÂ assessment
